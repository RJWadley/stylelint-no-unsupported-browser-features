/*
The feature
'properties.alt' does not have MDN documentation or a relevant spec available,
indicating it is likely not a standard or testable CSS feature in the context of
this linter's typical checks for browser compatibility. It's unclear what
'properties.alt' refers to without further context or documentation, making it
untestable as a CSS property or value combination for browser support problems.
Thus, it cannot be tested as a standard CSS feature for browser compatibility or
unsupported usage, and no tests can be written for it based on the provided
information
