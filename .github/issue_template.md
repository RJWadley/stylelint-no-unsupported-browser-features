Before creating an issue:

1. As mentioned in the readme, this plugin uses [doiuse](https://github.com/anandthakker/doiuse) to detect browser support. If you're having an issue with detection, make sure it isn't a doiuse issue by testing with doiuse directly. If the issue also occurs when using doiuse directly it should be fixed in doiuse and there's no use in opening an issue for it in this repo.
2. If you're encountering a bug, please accompany your bug report with a PR that adds a failing test that demonstrates the bug.
