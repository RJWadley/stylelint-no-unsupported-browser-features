## Before opening an issue

* The issues aren't meant for support requests but for reporting bugs and feature requests. If you
have a support request then please check the [README](https://github.com/ismay/stylelint-no-unsupported-browser-features)
for this project first. If that doesn't solve it make sure to check out the [stylelint docs](https://stylelint.io/),
[doiuse docs](https://github.com/anandthakker/doiuse) and [browserslist docs](https://github.com/ai/browserslist).
For further assistance or questions that aren't covered in the above use: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/stylelint

* If you're reporting a bug, please open either a pull request with a failing test demonstrating the
problem, or include a link to a repository with a reduced test case demonstrating the problem.
